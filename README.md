This week’s lab is based on the application of circuit analysis techniques to a resistive circuit in Multisim. You will learn to utilize Multisim to perform the mesh analysis.

<ol>

 <li>Work Exercise 48 from Chapter 4 to determine the current <strong>‘<em>i1’</em></strong> and power supplied by 1V source.</li>

</ol>

<ol start="2">

 <li>Redo the problem, this time without the dependent current source <strong>‘<em>5i1</em>’</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<ol start="3">

 <li>Fill in the calculated values in the table below:</li>

</ol>

<table width="95%">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td></td>

   <td>Calculated current ‘<strong><em>i1’</em></strong></td>

   <td>Calculated Power supplied by 1V</td>

   <td>Measured Current ‘<strong><em>i1’</em></strong></td>

   <td>Measured Power supplied by 1V</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td>With Dependent Source (<strong><em>5i1</em>)</strong></td>

   <td></td>

<ol start="4">

 <li>Construct Figure 4.73 from Chapter 4 in Multisim.

  <ol>

   <li>Run the simulation to measure the current ‘<strong><em>i1’</em></strong> and power supplied by 1V source record the measurements in the table. (Use 5% tolerances for each of the resistors)</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

<ol>

 <li>Next, remove the dependent source <strong>‘5<em>i1’</em></strong> from the circuit and run the simulation again to record the measurements in the table. (Use 5% tolerances for each of the resistors)</li>

</ol>

<ol>

 <li>Take the screen capture for the measurements of current and power supplied and dissipated by each resistor and complete the table above.</li>

</ol>




<ol start="5">

 <li>Answer the following questions:</li>

</ol>

<ol>

 <li>Are the measured values same as calculated values? If not, explain why they are different?</li>

</ol>

<ol start="2">

 <li>Is the supplied power distributed among all the components in the circuit? Show that total power supplied is equal to the sum of powers dissipated in each component.</li>

</ol>

<ol start="3">

 <li>What was the effect of removing the dependent source from the circuit? Does the overall power supplied or power dissipated change?</li>

</ol>

<ol start="4">

 <li>Save the analysis from step 1 &amp; 2 and simulation results from step 4 along with the table and screen captures of all the measurements. Make sure to answer the questions in step 5.</li>

</ol>

capacitive Circuits in Multisim

This lab is based on the application of circuit analysis techniques to a capacitive circuit in Multisim.

<ol>

 <li>Construct Figure 7.36 in Chapter 7 (Example 7.11) with Vs = 3sin200tV, R1=20kohms, Cf=5uF, and Vc(0) = 1.5 and find the output voltage ‘Vout’.</li>

</ol>




<ol start="2">

 <li>Interchange the positions of the capacitor and resistor and compute the output voltage ‘Vout’ and record the values in the table below.</li>

</ol>

<table width="95%">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td></td>

   <td>Calculated Vout</td>

   <td>Measured Vout</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td>Correct positions of R1 and Cf</td>

   <td></td>

   <td></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td>Interchanged positions of R1 and Cf</td>

   <td></td>

   <td></td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>
